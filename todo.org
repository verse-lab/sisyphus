* Limitations
** Invariants hidden in external lemmas
An example of such a case would be when we're dealing with a proof
style that first reifies an OCaml computation with a Gallina model,
and uses their equivalence as an invariant. Then once evaluating the
lemma, the proof calls out to an external lemma to reduce the proof.
* Tasks for the PROOF GOD
** TODO Add parsing unit tests for array_partition
** TODO You're the BEST around
