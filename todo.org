* Limitations
** Invariants hidden in external lemmas
An example of such a case would be when we're dealing with a proof
style that first reifies an OCaml computation with a Gallina model,
and uses their equivalence as an invariant. Then once evaluating the
lemma, the proof calls out to an external lemma to reduce the proof.
* Tasks for the PROOF GOD
** TODO Add parsing unit tests for array_partition
** DONE Test whether array iter works with list as parameter after invariant
CLOSED: [2022-10-20 Thu 02:46]
** DONE Update examples to use new interface to array iter
CLOSED: [2022-10-20 Thu 02:55]
** DONE Add function to PCFML to test if a function returns hprop
CLOSED: [2022-10-20 Thu 05:13]
** TODO from extract inv ty, return a list of concrete params + logical params ahtt follow the invariant
** TODO You're the BEST around
